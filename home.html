        <p>
        I'm a student at Brown Uniersity concentrating in Computer Science and Economics. I've done a lot of work in and out of school with data analysis and visualization, as well as user interface design and user experience work. In the summer of 2016, I had an internship at Charles River Analytics in Cambridge, MA, working on a computational linguistics-based UI that is being used to analyze cybersecurity systems and identify vulnerable threats.
