            I'm a student at Brown Uniersity concentrating in Computer Science and Economics, graduating May 2018. My coursework includes User Interfaces and User Experience, Data Science, Modern Web Applications, Systems Programming, and Algorithms and Data Structures. I've done work in academic and independent settings with data analysis and visualization, as well as user interface design and user experience work. In the summer of 2016, I had an internship at Charles River Analytics in Cambridge, MA, working on a computational linguistics-based UI that is being used to analyze cybersecurity systems and identify vulnerable threats. While there, I prototyped and iterated new user experiences with a small team and conducted a usability study to identify critical areas for further improvement.
